## [G-01] Use storage instead memory
When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a memory variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) for each field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional MLOAD rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declearing the variable with the memory keyword, declaring the variable with the storage keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a memory variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires memory, or if the array/struct is being read from another memory array/struct

use storage instead memory


## [G-02] x -= y (x += y) costs more gas than x = x – y (x = x + y) for state variables
x -= y costs more gas than x = x – y for state variables.

## recommendation
split x -= y (x += y) to x = x – y (x = x + y).
