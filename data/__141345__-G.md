#### `X = X + Y / X = X - Y` IS CHEAPER THAN `X += Y / X -= Y`

The demo of the gas comparison can be seen [here](https://github.com/141345/gas_demo/blob/main/gas_compare.sol).

Consider use `X = X + Y / X = X - Y` to save gas.

Instances number of this issue: 
```solidity
268        pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[pledgeId] -= rewardAmount;

340        pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[vars.newPledgeID] += vars.totalRewardAmount;
401        pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[pledgeId] += totalRewardAmount;
445        pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[pledgeId] += totalRewardAmount;
```


#### Update value order can be adjusted to simplify the code and save gas

For example, to update the `num` variable with `newVal`, the current way is as following:

```solidity
    uint oldVal = num;
    num = newVal;
    emit update(oldVal, newVal);
```

If the execution order is adjusted, some operations can be saved (memory space allocation, variable assignment), reducing both the deployment and run time gas cost.

```solidity
    emit update(num, newVal);
    num = newVal;
```

The operation saved: 1 sload, 1 memory allocation, 1 mstore.

There are multiple places can use this trick for optimization, since the updates of parameters are widely and frequently used, the optimization can be beneficial.

```solidity
    function updateChest(address chest) external onlyOwner {
        if(chest == address(0)) revert Errors.ZeroAddress();
        address oldChest = chestAddress;
        chestAddress = chest;

        emit ChestUpdated(oldChest, chest);
    }

    function updateMinTargetVotes(uint256 newMinTargetVotes) external onlyOwner {
        if(newMinTargetVotes == 0) revert Errors.InvalidValue();
        uint256 oldMinTarget = minTargetVotes;
        minTargetVotes = newMinTargetVotes;

        emit MinTargetUpdated(oldMinTarget, newMinTargetVotes);
    }

    function updatePlatformFee(uint256 newFee) external onlyOwner {
        if(newFee > 500) revert Errors.InvalidValue();
        uint256 oldfee = protocalFeeRatio;
        protocalFeeRatio = newFee;

        emit PlatformFeeUpdated(oldfee, newFee);
    }
```



#### Code reuse

Some function codes overlap.
Consider reuse the common part and save deployment gas.

- `retrievePledgeRewards()` and `closePledge()` codes overlap a lot, only a few lines of difference.

- the following are used in `extendPledge()`, `increasePledgeRewardPerVote()` and `_pledge()`:
```solidity
        Pledge storage pledgeParams = pledges[pledgeId];
        if(pledgeParams.closed) revert Errors.PledgeClosed();
        if(pledgeParams.endTimestamp <= block.timestamp) revert Errors.ExpiredPledge();
```


#### `pledgeParams.closed` could be deleted

This variable does not seem useful, since the check for `if(pledgeParams.endTimestamp <= block.timestamp)` can serve the purpose of `pledgeParams.closed`.

Consider delete `pledgeParams.closed`.
