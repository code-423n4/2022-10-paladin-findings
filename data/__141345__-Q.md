#### Event is missing indexed fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

#### Missing Equivalence Checks in Setters

Description: Setter functions are missing checks to validate if the new value being set is the same as the current value already set in the contract. Such checks will showcase mismatches between on-chain and off-chain states.

Suggestion: 
This may hinder detecting discrepancies between on-chain and off-chain states leading to flawed assumptions of on-chain state and protocol behavior.

        minTargetVotes = newMinTargetVotes;

        protocalFeeRatio = newFee;

        emit PlatformFeeUpdated(oldfee, newFee);
    }

#### Missing Time locks

When critical parameters of systems need to be changed, it is required to broadcast the change via event emission and recommended to enforce the changes after a time-delay. This is to allow system users to be aware of such critical changes and give them an opportunity to exit or adjust their engagement with the system accordingly. None of the onlyOwner functions that change critical protocol addresses/parameters have a timelock for a time-delayed change to alert: 
- users and give them a chance to engage/exit protocol if they are not agreeable to the changes 
- team in case of compromised owner(s) and give them a chance to perform incident response.

    }
```

Suggestion: 
Users may be surprised when critical parameters are changed. Furthermore, it can erode users' trust since they can’t be sure the protocol rules won’t be changed later on. Compromised owner keys may be used to change protocol addresses/parameters to benefit attackers. Without a time-delay, authorized owners have no time for any planned incident response. (May be medium since owner can change critical parameters at anytime that can affect the users poorly).
