### Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it’s not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each `event` should use three `indexed` fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

        address creator,
        address receiver,
        address rewardToken,
        uint256 targetVotes,
        uint256 rewardPerVote,
        uint256 endTimestamp
 92:    );
