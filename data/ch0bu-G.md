## 1. Add `unchecked {}` for substractions where the operands cannot underflow because of a previous `require()` or `if` statement

`require(a <= b); x = b - a` => `require(a <= b); unchecked { x = b - a }`

```
237	uint256 boostDuration = endTimestamp - block.timestamp;
385	uint256 addedDuration = newEndTimestamp - oldEndTimestamp;
430	uint256 remainingDuration = pledgeParams.endTimestamp - block.timestamp;
431	uint256 rewardPerVoteDiff = newRewardPerVote - oldRewardPerVote;
```

## 2. Usage of `uint/int` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html Each operation involving a `uint8` costs an extra 22-28 gas (depending on whether the other operand is also a variable of type `uint8`) as compared to ones involving `uint256`, due to the compiler having to clear the higher bits of the memory word before operating on the `uint8`, as well as the associated stack operations of doing so. Use a larger size then downcast where needed.

```
41	uint64 endTimestamp;
```

## 3. Not using the named return variables when a function returns, wastes deployment gas

```
154	return pledges.length;
164	return ownerPledges[user];
182	return (timestamp / WEEK) * WEEK;
357	return vars.newPledgeID;
```

## 4. Constructor parameters should be avoided when possible

Constructor parameters are expensive. The contract deployment will be cheaper in gas if they are hard coded instead of using constructor parameters.

```
140	chestAddress = _chestAddress;
142	minTargetVotes = _minTargetVotes
```
