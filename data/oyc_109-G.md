## [G-01] Don't Initialize Variables with Default Value

Uninitialized variables are assigned with the types default value. Explicitly initializing a variable with it's default value costs unnecesary gas.

```
WardenPledge.sol::547 => for(uint256 i = 0; i < length;){
```

## [G-02] Use Shift Right/Left instead of Division/Multiplication if possible

A division/multiplication by any number x being a power of 2 can be calculated by shifting log2(x) to the right/left.

While the DIV opcode uses 5 gas, the SHR opcode only uses 3 gas. Furthermore, Solidity's division operation also includes a division-by-0 prevention which is bypassed using shifting.

```
WardenPledge.sol::24 => uint256 public constant WEEK = 7 * 86400;
WardenPledge.sol::263 => uint256 totalDelegatedAmount = ((bias * boostDuration) + bias) / 2;
```

## [G-03] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked payable

If a function modifier such as onlyOwner is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are CALLVALUE(2),DUP1(3),ISZERO(3),PUSH2(3),JUMPI(10),PUSH1(3),DUP1(3),REVERT(0),JUMPDEST(1),POP(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost

```
WardenPledge.sol::541 => function addMultipleRewardToken(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata minRewardsPerSecond) external onlyOwner {
WardenPledge.sol::560 => function addRewardToken(address token, uint256 minRewardPerSecond) external onlyOwner {
WardenPledge.sol::570 => function updateRewardToken(address token, uint256 minRewardPerSecond) external onlyOwner {
WardenPledge.sol::585 => function removeRewardToken(address token) external onlyOwner {
WardenPledge.sol::599 => function updateChest(address chest) external onlyOwner {
WardenPledge.sol::612 => function updateMinTargetVotes(uint256 newMinTargetVotes) external onlyOwner {
WardenPledge.sol::625 => function updatePlatformFee(uint256 newFee) external onlyOwner {
WardenPledge.sol::636 => function pause() external onlyOwner {
WardenPledge.sol::643 => function unpause() external onlyOwner {
WardenPledge.sol::653 => function recoverERC20(address token) external onlyOwner returns(bool) {
```

## [G-04] Usage of uints/ints smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

```
WardenPledge.sol::41 => uint64 endTimestamp;
```

## [G-05] <x> += <y> costs more gas than <x> = <x> + <y> for state variables

use <x> = <x> + <y> or <x> = <x> - <y> instead to save gas

```
WardenPledge.sol::268 => pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[pledgeId] -= rewardAmount;
WardenPledge.sol::340 => pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[vars.newPledgeID] += vars.totalRewardAmount;
WardenPledge.sol::401 => pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[pledgeId] += totalRewardAmount;
WardenPledge.sol::445 => pledgeAvailableRewardAmounts[pledgeId] += totalRewardAmount;
```

## [G-06] Do not calculate constants

Due to how constant variables are implemented (replacements at compile-time), an expression assigned to a constant variable is recomputed each time that the variable is used, which wastes some gas.
Consequences: each usage of a constant costs more gas on each access. Since these are not real constants, they can't be referenced from a real constant environment (e.g. from assembly, or from another library)

```
WardenPledge.sol::24 => uint256 public constant WEEK = 7 * 86400;
```

## [G-07] Multiple address mappings can be combined into a single mapping of an address to a struct, where appropriate

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

```
WardenPledge.sol::52 => mapping(address => uint256[]) public ownerPledges;
WardenPledge.sol::67 => mapping(address => uint256) public minAmountRewardToken;
```

## [G-08] Using storage instead of memory for structs/arrays saves gas

When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a memory variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) for each field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional MLOAD rather than a cheap stack read.

Instead of declearing the variable with the memory keyword, declaring the variable with the storage keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a memory variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires memory, or if the array/struct is being read from another memory array/struct

```
WardenPledge.sol::227 => Pledge memory pledgeParams = pledges[pledgeId];
```

## [G-09] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared immutable

Avoids a Gsset (20000 gas) in the constructor, and replaces each Gwarmacces (100 gas) with a PUSH32 (3 gas).

```
WardenPledge.sol::71 => uint256 public protocalFeeRatio = 250; //bps
WardenPledge.sol::79 => uint256 public minDelegationTime = 1 weeks;
WardenPledge.sol::137 => votingEscrow = IVotingEscrow(_votingEscrow);
WardenPledge.sol::138 => delegationBoost = IBoostV2(_delegationBoost);
```
